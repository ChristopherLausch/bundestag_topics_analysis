This project is used to analyze the speeches by the German Bundestag of the 20th legislature period. 

The data extraction from the Bundestags open data service is done using the bundestag-protocol-extractor package https://github.com/maxboettinger/bundestag-protocol-extractor by Max Boettinger. 

To run the program, the data from the protocol extractor needs to be placed in the data folder and then the main function can be started. 

The notebooks called bundestag_analysis_... are deprecated
